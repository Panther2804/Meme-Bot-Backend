# Meme-Bot-Backend
This is the Home of @MemeMakerBot, a telgram Bot for easy Multi-Panel Meme creation.

## Usage
The Bot is available under the Telgegram Handle @MemeMakerBot. You can chat directly to the Bot, or add it to a group.
WARNING: Group Usage requires the Bot to be an Admin of the Group with the right to Delete Messages (the Bot removes all Messages related to its usage after the Meme is created to keep the Chat Spam-Free.

## Host it yourself
The current Version of the Bot is not intended to be Modified - Mainly Because of the unfriendlyness of my Code.
Im currently reworking the Bot to allow for easier customisation.

## Roadmap
Im currently Re-Working the Bot to allow for some new key-features:

- Better Text generation:
	- Centered Text
	- Drop Shadows
	- User-Customisable Color
- In-Line Use
- Creation of Custom Templates
- As well as some Minor improvements to General use

## Help Wanted
I once planned to add a webinterface to the Bot, where everybody could easily create templates, but the guy, who wanted to to the Web-Interface ghosted me.
If you are Interested in developing a Webinterface for this Bot, please Message me.
